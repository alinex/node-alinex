Package: alinex
=================================================

This is the base package for the alinex universe. Currently only
containing some overall description and rules for all the individual modules.

Maybe later it will become a whole system out of all the modules.

What is alinex?
-------------------------------------------------

Just now it is a modular, flexible and powerful tool set for applications for the
backend or frontend.
It aims to help the developer to create individual solutions in a fast and easy
but stable way.

The alinex package itself will become the base system which has a management
console for easy management:

- search for alinex applications
- install new alinex packages
- configure
- remove packages
- start and stop applications
