Package: alinex
=================================================

This is the base package for the alinex universe. Currently only
containing some overall description and rules for all the individual modules.

Maybe later it will become a whole system out of all the modules.


General Documentation
-------------------------------------------------

The base rules which are used in the development of the alinex modules are:

- [Development Guide](src/doc/developguide.md) - styleguide
- [Install](src/doc/install.md) - instructions
- [File Structure](src/doc/filestructure.md)
- [Modules](src/doc/modules.md) - overview
- [Modules by category](src/doc/category.md) - with links

Some language help collections:

- [CoffeeScript](src/doc/coffee.md) - language
- [JavaScript](src/doc/javascript.md) - language
- [Markdown](src/doc/markdown.md) - how to document

And finally some development tools:

- [Developer Tools](src/doc/developtools.md) - overview
- [npm](src/doc/npm.md) - package manager
- [git](src/doc/git.md) - source code repository
- [atom](src/doc/atom.md) - editor
- [sublime](src/doc/sublime.md) - editor


What is alinex?
-------------------------------------------------

Just now it is a modular, flexible and powerful tool set for web applications.
It aims to help the developer to create individual solutions in a fast and easy
but stable way.

The alinex package itself will become the base system which has a management
console for easy management:

- search for alinex applications
- install new alinex packages
- configure
- remove packages
- start and stop applications


Why I created it?
-------------------------------------------------

As I got more into the concept of node.js I found out that this is the ideal
solution for the alinex platform. I use this project to check new technologies
out and hopefully bring it more on the way than my php server part just now.

I worked further on creating a modular system with some of the great modules
available. Hardest thing is to find the best module for each job out of the
great repository.
With this project I went to new land (for me) in the web technologies and tried
lots of the current propagated technologies and patterns out.


Roadmap
-------------------------------------------------

There is no real roadmap for the time and functionality. It all depends on my
personal time and interests. But I will give a short overview of the big
points, what is planned for this year:

- make modules more robust
- base alinex application
- exec library working local and remote

See the [Planning Board](https://trello.com/b/lOY5hCx7/node-js) for more up to
date information of there I'm working at. Also the [Ideas](src/doc/ideas.md)
page will hold some general ideas and thoughts.
