IDE
-------------------------------------------------

You may use any IDE you want but as I tested some of the popular free ones I
had little till no support for CoffeeScript, Jade and other modern dialects.
So you may use some generic IDEs like Eclipse or NetBeans with less support or
some simpler Editors which often at least has a working syntax highlighting.

I for myself decided to use Sublime_Text which is a Texteditor with lots of
modules, Syntax Highlighting, Linting, GIT integration and lots more in a
fast way.

To get a good support I installed the following modules:

- PackageControl
- CoffeeScript
- SublimeGit
- SublimeLinter
