CoffeeScript Tipr & Tricks
=================================================

CoffeeScript is used as development language because it is very easy to write
and read. In my opinion it makes development and maintenance easier and faster.
Specially in the callback sequences of JavaScript.

This page lists some tricks and tips which are mostly not mentioned in the
official docs.

Also in this documentation which is aimed for the alinex developer I often use 
examples in coffee script. While in description of modules which may be used 
anywhere I will use javascript so anybody can read it.


Strings
-------------------------------------------------

### Check for substring

    if ~message.indexOf 'test'

The above syntax uses the tilde as bitwise or operator to get a boolean
readable value. If the substring is found it will be true, and false (0) if it
isnâ€™t.

Or use the negation:

    if !~message.indexOf 'test'


Control flow
-------------------------------------------------

### Try without catch

    try
      funcWhichMayThrowError()

If you ommit the catch the error will be supressed.

    try {
      funcWhichMayThrowError();
    } catch (_error) {}


Callbacks
-------------------------------------------------

### Serial but Asynchroneous

### Conditional step
