Package: alinex
=================================================

This is a base package containing of the alinex universe. Currently only
containing some overall description and rules.

Maybe later it will make a whole system out of all the modules.


Why I created it?
-------------------------------------------------

As I got more into the concept of node.js I found out that this is the ideal
solution for the alinex platform. I use this project to check new technologies
out and hopefully bring it more on the way than my php server part just now.

I worked further on creating a modular system with some of the great modules
available. Hardest thing is to find the best module for each job out of the
great repository.
With this project I went to new land (for me) in the web technologies and tried
lots of the current propagated technologies and patterns out.


What is alinex?
-------------------------------------------------

Just now it is a modular, flexible and powerful toolset for web applications.
It aims to help the developer to create individual solutions in a fast and easy
but stable way.

Till now it is only an incomplete collection mainly for the backend.


Roadmap
-------------------------------------------------

There is no real roadmap for the time and funtionality. It all depends on my
personal time and interests. But I will give a short overview what is planned
for now:

- base development system
- basic web server
- modular webapp system
- demo context module
- basic login management
- mongo db support
- admin console through web (as module)
- server monitor (as module)

After that more data storages, verification, queue support and more will come
with modules for user management, right management...
